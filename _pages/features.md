excerpt: "LibGDX is a Java game development framework that provides a unified API that works across all supported platforms."

intro:
  - excerpt: 'libGDX is an open-source, cross-platform game development framework built in Java. Unlike many popular editor-based platforms, libGDX is entirely code-centric, offering developers fine-grain control over every aspect of their game. It is the perfect place for exploring ground-up implementations, built on top of lightning-fast OpenGL, and distributable to Desktop, HTML, Android, and iOS.'

    title: "Cross-Platform"
    excerpt: 'LibGDX offers a single API to target: **Windows, Linux (including the Raspberry Pi), Mac OS, Android, iOS and Web**. Developers can use various backends to access the capabilities of the host platform, **without having to write platform-specific code**. Rendering is handled on all platforms through Open GL ES 2.0/3.0.'

    title: "Well proven"
    excerpt: 'The libGDX project was started over 10 years ago. Over the years, libGDX and its community matured: nowadays, libGDX is a **well proven and reliable framework** with a sound base and documenation. Furthermore, there are plenty of games built on top of libGDX, many of which are open source.'

# Feature Packed
_libGDX comes with batteries included. Write 2D or 3D games and let libGDX worry about low-level details._

- LibGDX provides you with everything you need for proper **2D development**, right out-of-the-box.
- **3D Graphics** are also supported via various high-level APIs. Take a look at our [showcase](/showcase/) to see some 3D games made with libGDX.
- **Super Fast:** Heavy emphasis was put on avoiding garbage collection for Dalvik/JavaScript by careful API design and the use of custom collections.
- **Small game sizes:** libGDX games can be very small – starting from around a couple MBs for Android games and even less than <60 MB for desktop projects with a bundled JRE

<br/>

# Do whatever you want
_Unlike many popular editor-based platforms, libGDX is entirely code-centric, offering developers fine-grain control over every aspect of their game._

- **Freedom:** While libGDX gives you access to various different tools and abstractions, you can still access the underlying base. LibGDX doesn't force you too use certain tools or coding styles: you are free to do whatever you want!
- **Open Source:** LibGDX is licensed under Apache 2.0 and maintained by the community, so you can take a look [under the hood](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and see how everything works.
- **Java:** Since libGDX uses Java, you can profit from the wide java ecosystem – Powerful IDEs, out-of-the-box support for Git, fined-tuned debuggers, performance profilers, an an abundance of well tried libraries and frameworks, as well as many resources and extensive documentation.
