# How to get started with libGDX?
## Set up a new project
LibGDX offers a community-made setup tool, which automatically creates a project and downloads everything necessary. You can download the setup tool on the [gdx-liftoff page](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff/releases). **Setup instruction** can be found **[here](/dev/setup/)**. See [here](/dev/running/) on how to get an imported project running.

## First Game
Our [wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-Simple-Game) details how you can create your very first libGDX game. If you're new to game dev and have never developed a game before, take a look at this (even more straight-forward) [tutorial](http://tann.space/HelloLibgdx/) by tann.

<br/>

# Documentation
The libGDX codebase is documented in two ways:
- In our [Wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)
- And via the [Javadocs](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/)

<br/>

# Tools & Libraries
## Tools
There are different tools that make the development process for libGDX easier. See our [tools list](/dev/tools/) for some of the most commonly used ones.

## Libraries
A curated list of our favourite libraries can be found at [awesome-libgdx](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx). On our Discord server we also have an extensive collection of libGDX-centered libraries that are currently work in progress.

# Contributing to libGDX
Contributing to LibGDX can come in a few different forms, you can help out on our discord, pledge to the [patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/libgdx), or submit [code](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/) and [documentation](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki) back to the project on github.

## Reporting an Issue
Please note the issue tracker isn't for personal assistance, if you have a problem that isn't a reproducable bug in the core framework, please use the [community](/community/) for assistance.
{: .notice--primary}

Before you report an issue on our issue tracker, we ask you to do a few things:
- Verify that the problem hasn't already been reported on the tracker
- Make sure the bug hasn't already been fixed. Use the latest SNAPSHOT of LibGDX to try to reproduce your issue
- Create a self contained example to demonstrate the issue. Don't hack a project down, start fresh to reproduce the error.

Once you have done this, please submit this along with any stacktraces or assets to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues), whilst filling out the template that is shown when creating a new issue.

## Working from Source
If you want to contribute to libGDX itself, you need to get it set up on your local machine. Instructions for that can be found [here](/dev/from_source/).
